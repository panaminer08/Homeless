About App:
This is a portal for information about the homeless in NYC. I have created api calls for the population of homeless in NYC by year, another for the homeless shelters in NYC with pertinent information, another for homeless youth out-reach, and also another api call for current articles about the homeless. This app should be very informational, and support actions taken to eradicate homelessness. 

* Ruby version 2.5.1

* System dependencies

* Database created with 3 tables including users that sign in and 
data that they enter, either donations or ideas to help the homeless.

* You would get this site up and running simply by clone/downloading the repository into your vscode, and running rails s in your terminal.
